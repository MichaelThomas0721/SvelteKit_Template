# SvelteKit TailwindCSS SASS TypeScript Template

This is a template I created with a stack that I use frequently, I decided not to include a database or cms
with it because that varies the most. If you aren't me, feel free to use this template, if there are any issues
you can submit an issue on GitHub and I'll see what I can do. Before submitting an issue, please try it with an
LTS version of node and npm.

## Setup

Before you start, you need to install all the node packages that come with the template.
```bash
npm install
```

## Startup

To start the dev server run the following
```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open

# or start with vite
npx vite --port=4000
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

### Happy Coding
